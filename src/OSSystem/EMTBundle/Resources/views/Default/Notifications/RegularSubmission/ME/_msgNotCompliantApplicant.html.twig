<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>We refer to the submission relating to the ref.EMT{{ conf.id }} - {{ conf.title }} starting 
    on {{ conf.startConferenceDate|date('d/m/Y') }} in {{ conf.assesmentCity }}, {{ conf.assesmentCountry }} (the “Conference”). 
    We would like to inform you that following our assessment we now confirm the decision that the Conference is:
    <span style="color: red;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;" >NOT COMPLIANT</span>
with the Mecomed Code of Ethical Business Practice, subject to the following:</p>
<p>- {{ conf.conferenceStatusText|raw }}</p>
<p>- <strong>Schedule of the scientific conference programme</strong>
    - The scientific program should be robust and correspond to a "normal"
    working day (i.e., a minimum of 6 hours for full conference day/ 3 hours for a half day).
    The detailed programme should present a clear schedule with unreasonable long breaks and 
    the faculty for each session must be identified, the session topics must be relevant medical subjects.</p>
<p>- <strong>Time of the year</strong>
    - The selected time of year must not be associated with a peak touristic season
    (for example, a ski resort in the winter, a beach resort in the summer or any other geographic
    location renowned purely as a seasonal vacation or holiday destination) unless attended only by “local”
    Healthcare Professionals who live or work in the specific geographic location in question or its immediate surrounding vicinity.</p>
<p>- <strong>The Conference Venue</strong>
    - The conference venue should be a business or commercial center
    providing conference facilities conductive to the exchange of scientific and medical information
    and the transmission of knowledge. It should not be the main attraction of the conference.
    The image of the location among the public, media and authorities cannot be perceived as purely luxury,
    touristic/holiday and/or an entertainment venue.</p>
<p>In rendering this decision, we have relied on the documents and information which have been provided to us. 
    We have not independently verified the accuracy of that information or of those documents nor have we determined 
    whether they are up-to-date.</p>
<p>Please note that members of Eucomed and Mecomed may not sponsor or cover expenses of Healthcare Professionals 
    to attend conferences organised by medical societies, professional conference organisers or other third-parties 
    in Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and UAE which have been determined as being not compliant with 
    the Mecomed Code of Ethical Business Practice.</p>
<p>This decision will be posted on
