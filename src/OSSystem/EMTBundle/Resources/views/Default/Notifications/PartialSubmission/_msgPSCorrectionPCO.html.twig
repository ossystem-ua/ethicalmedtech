<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>We refer to the partial submission relating to the ref.EMT{{ conf.id }} - {{ conf.title }} on 
    {{ conf.startConferenceDate|date('d/m/Y') }} in {{ conf.assesmentCity }}, {{ conf.assesmentCountry }} (the “Conference”).</p>
<p>A Eucomed member has requested that we provide them with our decision as to whether or not the
    criteria required for a partial assessment under the Conference Vetting System are compliant with the
    Eucomed Code of Ethical Business Practice.  This is to inform you that following our assessment we
    have come to the provisional determination that one or more of these criteria are
    <span style="color: red;text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;" >NOT COMPLIANT</span> subject to the following: </p>
<p>a. In rendering this provisional determination, we have relied on the documents and information which have been provided to us.</p>
<p>b. We have not independently verified the accuracy of that information or of those documents nor have we
    determined whether they are up-to-date.</p>
<p>In making our assessment, the following items were identified as  being non- compliant: </p>
<p><< The following highlighted content is subject to change on a case to case basis>>
    Hospitality - Spouses, partners, family and guests may not participate in hospitality sessions (coffee breaks, meals)</p>
<p>Please note that we provide 10 calendar days from the date of this letter for conference organizers to take
    corrective measures regarding non-compliant criteria relating to their conference.
    We  therefore invite you to send us by email, within that time period, documentation which
    clearly shows that appropriate corrective action has been taken to enable the Conference to
    receive an assessment of compliance with the Eucomed Code of Ethical Business Practice.</p>
<p>If we do not receive such documentation by the end of business on {{ "now"|date_modify("+10 day")|date("d/m/Y") }},
    we will issue a final non-compliant decision for the Conference that will be posted on www.ethicalmedtech.eu. </p>
<p>Members of Eucomed and of national associations affiliated with Eucomed may not sponsor or cover
    expenses of Healthcare Professionals to attend conferences organised by medical societies,
    professional conference organisers or other third parties unless the conference is in compliance with
    the Eucomed Code of Ethical Business Practice. </p> <br />
<p>Sincerely,<br />
