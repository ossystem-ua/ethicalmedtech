<p>A Eucomed member has requested that we provide them with our decision as to whether or not the Conference
    is compliant with the Eucomed Code of Ethical Business Practice.  This is to inform you that following
    our assessment we have come to the provisional determination that the Conference is:

<p>{{ conf.comments| raw}}</p>
<p>Please note that we allow a 10 calendar day window from the date of this letter for conference
    organizers to take corrective measures regarding non-compliant matters relating to their conferences.
    In this regard, we invite you to send to me by email within that time period documentation which
    clearly shows that appropriate corrective action has been taken to make the Conference compliant
    with the Eucomed Code of Ethical Business Practice.</p>
<p>If we do not receive such documentation by the end of business on {{ "now"|date_modify("+10 day")|date("d/m/Y") }}, we will issue a final
    non-compliant decision for the Conference that will be posted on <a href="http://www.ethicalmedtech.eu">www.ethicalmedtech.eu</a> . </p>

    expenses of Healthcare Professionals to attend conferences organised by medical societies,
    professional conference organisers or other third-parties unless the conference is in compliance
    with the Eucomed Code of Ethical Business Practice. </p> <br />
