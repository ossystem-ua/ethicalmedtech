<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>We refer to the submission related to ref.EMT{{ conf.id }} - {{ conf.title }} on 
    {{ conf.startConferenceDate|date('d/m/Y') }} in {{ conf.assesmentCity }}, {{ conf.assesmentCountry }} (the “Conference”).
You have requested that we provide you with my decision as to whether or not the Conference
is compliant with the Eucomed Code of Ethical Business Practice. </p>
<p>We would like to inform you that the current scope of the Conference Vetting System only 
    covers the assessment of European Conferences. National and international conferences will
    not be assessed at this stage. Therefore we have not assessed your submission and will not
    publish a decision on the EthicalMedTech platform regarding the Conference. </p>
<p>Please note that in the future the Conference Vetting System may be expanded to include additional categories of conferences.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />
