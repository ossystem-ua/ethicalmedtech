<p>To whom it may concern, </p>
<p>We refer to the submission related to ref.EMT{{ conf.id }} - {{ conf.title }} on
       {{ conf.startConferenceDate|date('d/m/Y') }} in {{ conf.assesmentCity }}, {{ conf.assesmentCountry }} (the “Conference”).
       A temporary (provisional?) decision had been rendered based on the partial information you had provided.
       However, because the information required on the missing criteria was not submitted within the deadline of
       35 days prior to the conference, the Compliance Officer has been unable to render a final decision.
       The overall conference status has thus been changed to: <strong>NOT ASSESSED</strong>.</p> <br />
<p>Sincerely,<br />

Compliance Officer</p>
